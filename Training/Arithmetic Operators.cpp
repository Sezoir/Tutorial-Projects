/*
	-C++ has a wide range of arithmetic operators, some of these include +, -, *, /, %.
	-Note that the "%" operator can be used to get the remainder of interger division, i.e 42/5 would give remainder 2.
	-There are also uninary versions of the "+" and "-" operators. So -i would give -5.
	-The + operator can also be used with strings to combine them together (note this is an operator overload, 
	 i.e x + y would give "This is a string This is another string".
