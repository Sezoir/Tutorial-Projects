/*
	The assignment operators is represented as the "=" operator.
	The assignment operator has two different modes, they being:
		- The copy mode takes a copy on the rhs and copies it to the lhs, i.e i = 5;
		  This mode can be chainged together to copy multiple values from the rhs, i.e a = b = c, a and b would take a copy from c.
		- The initilisation mode which can initialise a set of variables, i.e for a struct: struct s s1 = { 1, 2, 3 }
