/*
	Operator precedence is the order of evaluation of a number of arithmatic operatos.
	The order of evaluation is; parentheses (), division /, multiplication *, addition +, then subtraction -.
	Most of the time it is best to use parentheses to specify the order that you want your operators to be evaluated in.

	A table of operator precedence can be found here: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence
