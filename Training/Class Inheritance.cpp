/*
	- Class inheritance is the ability to reuse code that is derived from a base class.
	- The derived class will typically inherit and build upon some of the data of the function members of the base class.
	- The base class has members to be used for the new class, sometimes called superclass of parent class.
	- The derived class is the class being created and based upon the base class, sometimes called a subclass or child class.
	- There are three different levels of members access, these access levels determine what other objects can access class members:
		- Public access members are available to all objects, thats is the base class, derived class and other unrelated objects.
		- Protected access members are available to the base class and the derived class.
		- Private access members are only available to the base class.
	- In addition to adding members to a class, derived classes can overload members of it's base class.
	- Overloaded members are used for changing or customising certain behavoirs of it's base class.
